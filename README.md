# Timmy

Timmy is a [Discord](https://discord.com) Bot made for the Norwegian [NaNoWrimo](https://nanowrimo.org) community, NaNoNorge, to replace the [IRC Bot Timmy](https://github.com/utoxin/TimTheWordWarBot) after migrating from IRC to Discord. There is no association between the two bots beyond this. 

Pillowlist, Prompts, Hydras and MÃ¸belet have all been provided by users. 

Active development of Timmy is currently on hold awaiting [Discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) v2.0, for which a full overhaul is planned.
As Timmy is tailor made for the NaNoNorge server, some functionality behaves poorly if Timmy is used in several servers simultaneously. This will be remedied in the discord.py v2.0 overhaul. 

Feedback and bug reports regarding Timmy are handled in the NaNoNorge server.
